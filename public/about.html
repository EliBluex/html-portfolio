<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Elisha Barr. I'm proud to say that I've dedicated my time to becoming a great coder. Design has always been in my DNA (My mother helped me remember that while I was in college).
  I decided to take this path because it is something I am passionate about. I have alwyays been able to learn new things quickly so I know that I can excel in this field if I try my best. God
  is on my side and in my heart. I can never fail!
